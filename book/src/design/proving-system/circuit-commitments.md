# Circuit commitments

## Committing to the circuit assignments

At the start of proof creation, the prover has a table of cell assignments that it claims
satisfy the constraint system. The table has $n = 2^k$ rows, and is broken into advice,
auxiliary, and fixed columns. We define $F_{i,j}$ as the assignment in the $j$th row of
the $i$th fixed column. Without loss of generality, we'll similarly define $A_{i,j}$ to
represent the advice and auxiliary assignments.

> The only difference between advice and auxiliary columns, is that the commitments to
> auxiliary columns are not placed in the proof, and are instead computed by the verifier.

To commit to these assignments, we construct Lagrange polynomials of degree $n - 1$ for
each column, over an evaluation domain of size $n$ (where $\omega$ is the $n$th primitive
root of unity):

- $a_i(X)$ interpolates such that $a_i(\omega^j) = A_{i,j}$.
- $f_i(X)$ interpolates such that $f_i(\omega^j) = F_{i,j}$.

We then create a blinding commitment to the polynomial for each column:

$$\mathbf{A} = [\text{Commit}(a_0(X)), \dots, \text{Commit}(a_i(X))]$$
$$\mathbf{F} = [\text{Commit}(f_0(X)), \dots, \text{Commit}(f_i(X))]$$

$\mathbf{F}$ is constructed as part of key generation (pre-computed by both the prover and
verifier, using a blinding factor of $1$). $\mathbf{A}$ is constructed by the prover and
sent to the verifier.

## Committing to the lookup permutations and equality constraint permutations

TBD.

The prover ends up with vectors of commitments $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{P}$.
